# Gameschool_Academy
Gameschool Academy was founded in 2013 by Meg Grooms.


## Appearance
<BR>
Gameschool Academy has evolved from a standard mommy blog to a full website containing informational posts, printable resources, and a community of over 32K members.


## HTML5 Coding Examples
<br> 
I taught myself HTML more than 25 years ago and have worked hard to keep my coding up-to-date. I now use a mixture of HTML5 and customizable pre-written AI coding included with my website packages.


## WooCommerce
<br>
While I began using Ecwid as my store software, I switched to WooCommerce a year later. WooCommerce is an ever-changing software program that updates approximately once every 8 weeks.
